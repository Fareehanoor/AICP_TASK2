An electric mountain railway makes four return trips every day. In each trip, the train
goes up the mountain and back down. The train leaves from the foot of the mountain
at 09:00, 11:00, 13:00, and 15:00. The train returns from the top of the mountain at
10:00, 12:00, 14:00, and 16:00. Each train has six coaches with eighty seats available
in each coach. Passengers can only purchase a return ticket; all tickets must be
purchased on the day of travel. The cost is $25 for the journey up and $25 for the
journey down. Groups of between ten and eighty passengers inclusive get a free ticket
for every tenth passenger, provided they all travel together (every tenth passenger
travels free). Passengers must book their return train journey, as well as the departure
train journey when they purchase their ticket. Passengers can return on the next train
down the mountain or a later train. The last train from the top
of the mountain has two extra coaches on it.
The train times are displayed on a large screen, together with the number of tickets
still available for each train. Every time a ticket is booked the display is updated.
When a train is full, the word ‘Closed’ is displayed instead of the number of tickets
available.
Write and test a program for the electric mountain railway.
You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.
Task 1 – Start of the day.
Write a program to set up the screen display for the start of the day. Initialize suitable
data structure(s) to total passengers for each train journey and total the money taken
for each train journey. Each train journey must be totaled separately. There are four
journeys up and four journeys down every day.

Task 2 – Purchasing tickets.
Tickets can be purchased for a single passenger or a group. When making a purchase,
check that the number of tickets for the required train journeys up and down the
mountain is available. If the tickets are available, calculate the total price including
any group discount. Update the screen display and the data for the totals.
Task 3 – End of the day.
Display the number of passengers that traveled on each train journey and the total
money taken for each train journey. Calculate and display the total number of
passengers and the total amount of money taken for the day. Find and display the
train journey with the most passengers that day.
